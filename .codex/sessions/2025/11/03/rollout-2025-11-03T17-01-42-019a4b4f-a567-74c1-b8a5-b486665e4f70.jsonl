Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

The goal is to determine how much Id have for retirement. The earnings from his investment, I will provide the initial value, monthly interest, and the annual interest income, years investing, annual custody tax, if this has come cotas, this is based on the Brazilian market and its monetary laws, the out put will be the final amount(interest + sum of the month sports), interest incomes, amount without interests, interests, gov taxs, amount after taxs, and aliquots, the app should be fluid and intuitive and fit the newstet I phones\"\n \n ## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n \n-<!--\n-  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.\n-  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,\n-  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.\n-  \n-  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.\n-  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:\n-  - Developed independently\n-  - Tested independently\n-  - Deployed independently\n-  - Demonstrated to users independently\n--->\n-\n-### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)\n-\n-[Describe this user journey in plain language]\n-\n-**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]\n-\n-**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., \"Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]\"]\n-\n-**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n-\n-1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]\n-2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]\n+### User Story 1 - Retirement Balance Simulation (Priority: P1)\n+\n+As a saver planning retirement, I enter my initial capital, monthly contributions, expected returns, investment horizon, and taxes to immediately see monthly growth and the final balance for my goal.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: This journey delivers the core promise of the app—showing whether the user is on track for retirement—so it must work end-to-end before any enhancements.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Provide a known example with spreadsheet-calculated results, run the simulation, and confirm the summary outputs match the reference within the defined tolerance.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** a user enters valid initial amount, monthly contribution, monthly interest rate, annualized yield, years investing, custody tax, and disables come-cotas, **When** they tap calculate, **Then** the app displays final amount, total contributions, total interest, gross tax amount, net after taxes, and the effective aliquot on the results screen.\n+2. **Given** a user provides valid data for more than one year, **When** they open the monthly breakdown, **Then** each month lists starting balance, contribution, interest earned, cumulative totals, and remaining horizon consistent with the summary totals.\n \n ---\n \n-### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)\n-\n-[Describe this user journey in plain language]\n-\n-**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]\n-\n-**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]\n-\n-**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n-\n-1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]\n+### User Story 2 - Compare Come-Cotas Impact (Priority: P2)\n+\n+As an investor evaluating funds subject to come-cotas, I toggle the come-cotas option to understand how semiannual tax withholding affects my retirement total.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: Brazilian investors often hold funds with and without come-cotas; contrasting the impact is a high-value decision aid once the base simulator exists.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Run the same scenario twice (come-cotas on/off) and verify the tax collections and final balance shift according to the Brazilian withholding rules.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** a user has entered valid investment parameters and enabled come-cotas, **When** they calculate the projection, **Then** the results show semiannual tax debits in May and November, a reduced final balance compared to the no come-cotas scenario, and an explanatory note that come-cotas was applied.\n \n ---\n \n-### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)\n-\n-[Describe this user journey in plain language]\n-\n-**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]\n-\n-**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]\n-\n-**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n-\n-1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]\n+### User Story 3 - Review Tax Breakdown on Mobile (Priority: P3)\n+\n+As a mobile user double-checking my tax exposure, I view the summary on a modern iPhone without horizontal scrolling and can clearly read the amounts and aliquots.\n+\n+**Why this priority**: The product must stay usable on the newest iPhones to build trust and reduce churn, even if layout polish follows the core calculations.\n+\n+**Independent Test**: Open the results screen on an iPhone 15-or-equivalent viewport, verify all tax components fit within the view, and confirm tap targets meet accessibility guidelines.\n+\n+**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n+\n+1. **Given** the simulator has produced results, **When** the user opens the summary on a 6.1\" iPhone viewport, **Then** the amounts and labels display without horizontal scroll, tap targets are at least 44px high, and key tax numbers remain legible.\n \n ---\n \n-[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]\n-\n ### Edge Cases\n \n-<!--\n-  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.\n-  Fill them out with the right edge cases.\n--->\n-\n-- What happens when [boundary condition]?\n-- How does system handle [error scenario]?\n+- Zero monthly contribution or zero initial capital should still calculate, showing growth (or lack thereof) from the remaining inputs.\n+- Interest rates at or below 0% must trigger guidance that returns will not grow the balance and produce accurate (possibly declining) projections.\n+- Custody tax or income tax rates entered above regulatory limits must be rejected with a helpful message.\n+- Durations longer than 40 years or non-integer years should prompt the user to adjust to a supported range before calculating.\n \n ## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n \n-<!--\n-  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.\n-  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.\n--->\n-\n ### Functional Requirements\n \n-- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., \"allow users to create accounts\"]\n-- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., \"validate email addresses\"]  \n-- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., \"reset their password\"]\n-- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., \"persist user preferences\"]\n-- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., \"log all security events\"]\n-\n-*Example of marking unclear requirements:*\n-\n-- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]\n-- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]\n+- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to enter initial investment, recurring monthly contribution, monthly interest rate, equivalent annual yield, investment duration in years, annual custody tax rate, and whether the asset is subject to come-cotas.\n+- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that monetary values are non-negative, that rates fall between 0% and 100%, and that duration is within 1–40 years, providing inline errors when entries fall outside the supported range.\n+- **FR-003**: System MUST reconcile the provided monthly and annual yields, alerting the user when the implied annual rate differs by more than 0.1 percentage points from the entered annual value and allowing them to proceed only after confirming or correcting the inputs.\n+- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a month-by-month projection using the validated monthly rate, adding contributions first, applying returns, and rounding monetary outputs to two decimal places at each step.\n+- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate total contributions, gross interest earned, accumulated custody tax, income tax debits, final gross balance, and net balance after taxes for the entire investment horizon.\n+- **FR-006**: System MUST apply Brazilian income tax brackets for fixed-income funds (22.5%, 20%, 17.5%, 15% based on holding period) and, when come-cotas is enabled, deduct the appropriate withholding in May and November while reconciling any remaining tax at redemption.\n+- **FR-007**: System MUST deduct the annual custody tax by pro-rating it across the year (monthly or annual debit) before calculating net results, and clearly show the total custody cost in the summary.\n+- **FR-008**: System MUST display the outputs requested by the user—final amount (contributions plus interest), total contributions without interest, total interest, government taxes paid, amount after taxes, and effective aliquots—in a layout optimized for current iPhone screen sizes.\n+- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a collapsible breakdown that lets users switch between summary totals and detailed monthly tables without recalculating the scenario.\n \n ### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n \n-- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]\n-- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]\n+- **Investment Scenario**: Captures user-provided parameters (initial balance, monthly contribution, interest assumptions, duration, custody tax, come-cotas flag) and the validation state for each field.\n+- **Tax Schedule**: Encapsulates Brazilian income tax brackets and come-cotas withholding events used to compute periodic tax debits relative to the investment horizon.\n+- **Simulation Summary**: Stores calculated totals (contributions, interest, custody tax, income tax, net balance, effective aliquot) and references the month-by-month ledger used for drill-down.\n+\n+## Assumptions\n+\n+- Users contribute the same amount every month; the system treats missed or variable contributions as outside the feature scope.\n+- Monthly interest rate represents expected gross performance before taxes, and the annual yield supplied by the user is intended as the effective annual rate for cross-checking purposes.\n+- Income tax calculations follow the standard Brazilian long-term fund brackets (22.5% up to 6 months, 20% up to 12 months, 17.5% up to 24 months, 15% beyond 24 months), with come-cotas withholding occurring in May and November.\n+- Custody tax is charged once per year at the entered rate and is applied proportionally across months for simulation accuracy.\n+- The interface targets current iPhone models (e.g., iPhone 14–16 family) with support for both light and dark modes; tablets and desktop layouts are handled separately.\n \n ## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n \n-<!--\n-  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.\n-  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.\n--->\n-\n ### Measurable Outcomes\n \n-- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., \"Users can complete account creation in under 2

The goal is to determine how much Id have for retirement. The earnings from his investment, I will provide the initial value, monthly interest, and the annual interest income, years investing, annual custody tax, if this has come cotas, this is based on the Brazilian market and its monetary laws, the out put will be the final amount(interest + sum of the month sports), interest incomes, amount without interests, interests, gov taxs, amount after taxs, and aliquots, the app should be fluid and intuitive and fit the newstet I phones\\\"\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Retirement Balance Simulation (Priority: P1)\\n\\nAs a saver planning retirement, I enter my initial capital, monthly contributions, expected returns, investment horizon, and taxes to immediately see monthly growth and the final balance for my goal.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: This journey delivers the core promise of the app—showing whether the user is on track for retirement—so it must work end-to-end before any enhancements.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Provide a known example with spreadsheet-calculated results, run the simulation, and confirm the summary outputs match the reference within the defined tolerance.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a user enters valid initial amount, monthly contribution, monthly interest rate, annualized yield, years investing, custody tax, and disables come-cotas, **When** they tap calculate, **Then** the app displays final amount, total contributions, total interest, gross tax amount, net after taxes, and the effective aliquot on the results screen.\\n2. **Given** a user provides valid data for more than one year, **When** they open the monthly breakdown, **Then** each month lists starting balance, contribution, interest earned, cumulative totals, and remaining horizon consistent with the summary totals.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Compare Come-Cotas Impact (Priority: P2)\\n\\nAs an investor evaluating funds subject to come-cotas, I toggle the come-cotas option to understand how semiannual tax withholding affects my retirement total.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Brazilian investors often hold funds with and without come-cotas; contrasting the impact is a high-value decision aid once the base simulator exists.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Run the same scenario twice (come-cotas on/off) and verify the tax collections and final balance shift according to the Brazilian withholding rules.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a user has entered valid investment parameters and enabled come-cotas, **When** they calculate the projection, **Then** the results show semiannual tax debits in May and November, a reduced final balance compared to the no come-cotas scenario, and an explanatory note that come-cotas was applied.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Review Tax Breakdown on Mobile (Priority: P3)\\n\\nAs a mobile user double-checking my tax exposure, I view the summary on a modern iPhone without horizontal scrolling and can clearly read the amounts and aliquots.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: The product must stay usable on the newest iPhones to build trust and reduce churn, even if layout polish follows the core calculations.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Open the results screen on an iPhone 15-or-equivalent viewport, verify all tax components fit within the view, and confirm tap targets meet accessibility guidelines.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the simulator has produced results, **When** the user opens the summary on a 6.1\\\" iPhone viewport, **Then** the amounts and labels display without horizontal scroll, tap targets are at least 44px high, and key tax numbers remain legible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- Zero monthly contribution or zero initial capital should still calculate, showing growth (or lack thereof) from the remaining inputs.\\n- Interest rates at or below 0% must trigger guidance that returns will not grow the balance and produce accurate (possibly declining) projections.\\n- Custody tax or income tax rates entered above regulatory limits must be rejected with a helpful message.\\n- Durations longer than 40 years or non-integer years should prompt the user to adjust to a supported range before calculating.\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to enter initial investment, recurring monthly contribution, monthly interest rate, equivalent annual yield, investment duration in years, annual custody tax rate, and whether the asset is subject to come-cotas.\\n- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that monetary values are non-negative, that rates fall between 0% and 100%, and that duration is within 1–40 years, providing inline errors when entries fall outside the supported range.\\n- **FR-003**: System MUST reconcile the provided monthly and annual yields, alerting the user when the implied annual rate differs by more than 0.1 percentage points from the entered annual value and allowing them to proceed only after confirming or correcting the inputs.\\n- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a month-by-month projection using the validated monthly rate, adding contributions first, applying returns, and rounding monetary outputs to two decimal places at each step.\\n- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate total contributions, gross interest earned, accumulated custody tax, income tax debits, final gross balance, and net balance after taxes for the entire investment horizon.\\n- **FR-006**: System MUST apply Brazilian income tax brackets for fixed-income funds (22.5%, 20%, 17.5%, 15% based on holding period) and, when come-cotas is enabled, deduct the appropriate withholding in May and November while reconciling any remaining tax at redemption.\\n- **FR-007**: System MUST deduct the annual custody tax by pro-rating it across the year (monthly or annual debit) before calculating net results, and clearly show the total custody cost in the summary.\\n- **FR-008**: System MUST display the outputs requested by the user—final amount (contributions plus interest), total contributions without interest, total interest, government taxes paid, amount after taxes, and effective aliquots—in a layout optimized for current iPhone screen sizes.\\n- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a collapsible breakdown that lets users switch between summary totals and detailed monthly tables without recalculating the scenario.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Investment Scenario**: Captures user-provided parameters (initial balance, monthly contribution, interest assumptions, duration, custody tax, come-cotas flag) and the validation state for each field.\\n- **Tax Schedule**: Encapsulates Brazilian income tax brackets and come-cotas withholding events used to compute periodic tax debits relative to the investment horizon.\\n- **Simulation Summary**: Stores calculated totals (contributions, interest, custody tax, income tax, net balance, effective aliquot) and references the month-by-month ledger used for drill-down.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Users contribute the same amount every month; the system treats missed or variable contributions as outside the feature scope.\\n- Monthly interest rate represents expected gross performance before taxes, and the annual yield supplied by the user is intended as the effective annual rate for cross-checking purposes.\\n- Income tax calculations follow the standard Brazilian long-term fund brackets (22.5% up to 6 months, 20% up to 12 months, 17.5% up to 24 months, 15% beyond 24 months), with come-cotas withholding occurring in May and November.\\n- Custody tax is charged once per year at the entered rate and is applied proportionally across months for simulation accuracy.\\n- The interface targets current iPhone models (e.g., iPhone 14–16 family) with support for both light and dark modes; tablets and desktop layouts are handled separately.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: For scenarios up to 40 years with monthly contributions and standard tax rates, the full calculation and summary display within 2 seconds on a modern iPhone.\\n- **SC-002**: When compared to a verified spreadsheet model, the final balance and total tax values differ by no more than 0.5%.\\n- **SC-003**: In moderated usability tests, at least 80% of participants can correctly identify the net amount after taxes and the effective aliquot without facilitator assistance.\\n- **SC-004**: On a 6.1\\\" iPhone reference device, all monetary values and labels remain legible (minimum 14pt equivalent) and no horizontal scrolling is required in portrait orientation.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.1}}"}}

The goal is to determine how much Id have for retirement. The earnings from his investment, I will provide the initial value, monthly interest, and the annual interest income, years investing, annual custody tax, if this has come cotas, this is based on the Brazilian market and its monetary laws, the out put will be the final amount(interest + sum of the month sports), interest incomes, amount without interests, interests, gov taxs, amount after taxs, and aliquots, the app should be fluid and intuitive and fit the newstet I phones\\\"\\n     7\\t\\n     8\\t## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n     9\\t\\n    10\\t### User Story 1 - Retirement Balance Simulation (Priority: P1)\\n    11\\t\\n    12\\tAs a saver planning retirement, I enter my initial capital, monthly contributions, expected returns, investment horizon, and taxes to immediately see monthly growth and the final balance for my goal.\\n    13\\t\\n    14\\t**Why this priority**: This journey delivers the core promise of the app—showing whether the user is on track for retirement—so it must work end-to-end before any enhancements.\\n    15\\t\\n    16\\t**Independent Test**: Provide a known example with spreadsheet-calculated results, run the simulation, and confirm the summary outputs match the reference within the defined tolerance.\\n    17\\t\\n    18\\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n    19\\t\\n    20\\t1. **Given** a user enters valid initial amount, monthly contribution, monthly interest rate, annualized yield, years investing, custody tax, and disables come-cotas, **When** they tap calculate, **Then** the app displays final amount, total contributions, total interest, gross tax amount, net after taxes, and the effective aliquot on the results screen.\\n    21\\t2. **Given** a user provides valid data for more than one year, **When** they open the monthly breakdown, **Then** each month lists starting balance, contribution, interest earned, cumulative totals, and remaining horizon consistent with the summary totals.\\n    22\\t\\n    23\\t---\\n    24\\t\\n    25\\t### User Story 2 - Compare Come-Cotas Impact (Priority: P2)\\n    26\\t\\n    27\\tAs an investor evaluating funds subject to come-cotas, I toggle the come-cotas option to understand how semiannual tax withholding affects my retirement total.\\n    28\\t\\n    29\\t**Why this priority**: Brazilian investors often hold funds with and without come-cotas; contrasting the impact is a high-value decision aid once the base simulator exists.\\n    30\\t\\n    31\\t**Independent Test**: Run the same scenario twice (come-cotas on/off) and verify the tax collections and final balance shift according to the Brazilian withholding rules.\\n    32\\t\\n    33\\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n    34\\t\\n    35\\t1. **Given** a user has entered valid investment parameters and enabled come-cotas, **When** they calculate the projection, **Then** the results show semiannual tax debits in May and November, a reduced final balance compared to the no come-cotas scenario, and an explanatory note that come-cotas was applied.\\n    36\\t\\n    37\\t---\\n    38\\t\\n    39\\t### User Story 3 - Review Tax Breakdown on Mobile (Priority: P3)\\n    40\\t\\n    41\\tAs a mobile user double-checking my tax exposure, I view the summary on a modern iPhone without horizontal scrolling and can clearly read the amounts and aliquots.\\n    42\\t\\n    43\\t**Why this priority**: The product must stay usable on the newest iPhones to build trust and reduce churn, even if layout polish follows the core calculations.\\n    44\\t\\n    45\\t**Independent Test**: Open the results screen on an iPhone 15-or-equivalent viewport, verify all tax components fit within the view, and confirm tap targets meet accessibility guidelines.\\n    46\\t\\n    47\\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n    48\\t\\n    49\\t1. **Given** the simulator has produced results, **When** the user opens the summary on a 6.1\\\" iPhone viewport, **Then** the amounts and labels display without horizontal scroll, tap targets are at least 44px high, and key tax numbers remain legible.\\n    50\\t\\n    51\\t---\\n    52\\t\\n    53\\t### Edge Cases\\n    54\\t\\n    55\\t- Zero monthly contribution or zero initial capital should still calculate, showing growth (or lack thereof) from the remaining inputs.\\n    56\\t- Interest rates at or below 0% must trigger guidance that returns will not grow the balance and produce accurate (possibly declining) projections.\\n    57\\t- Custody tax or income tax rates entered above regulatory limits must be rejected with a helpful message.\\n    58\\t- Durations longer than 40 years or non-integer years should prompt the user to adjust to a supported range before calculating.\\n    59\\t\\n    60\\t## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n    61\\t\\n    62\\t### Functional Requirements\\n    63\\t\\n    64\\t- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to enter initial investment, recurring monthly contribution, monthly interest rate, equivalent annual yield, investment duration in years, annual custody tax rate, and whether the asset is subject to come-cotas.\\n    65\\t- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that monetary values are non-negative, that rates fall between 0% and 100%, and that duration is within 1–40 years, providing inline errors when entries fall outside the supported range.\\n    66\\t- **FR-003**: System MUST reconcile the provided monthly and annual yields, alerting the user when the implied annual rate differs by more than 0.1 percentage points from the entered annual value and allowing them to proceed only after confirming or correcting the inputs.\\n    67\\t- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a month-by-month projection using the validated monthly rate, adding contributions first, applying returns, and rounding monetary outputs to two decimal places at each step.\\n    68\\t- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate total contributions, gross interest earned, accumulated custody tax, income tax debits, final gross balance, and net balance after taxes for the entire investment horizon.\\n    69\\t- **FR-006**: System MUST apply Brazilian income tax brackets for fixed-income funds (22.5%, 20%, 17.5%, 15% based on holding period) and, when come-cotas is enabled, deduct the appropriate withholding in May and November while reconciling any remaining tax at redemption.\\n    70\\t- **FR-007**: System MUST deduct the annual custody tax by pro-rating it across the year (monthly or annual debit) before calculating net results, and clearly show the total custody cost in the summary.\\n    71\\t- **FR-008**: System MUST display the outputs requested by the user—final amount (contributions plus interest), total contributions without interest, total interest, government taxes paid, amount after taxes, and effective aliquots—in a layout optimized for current iPhone screen sizes.\\n    72\\t- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a collapsible breakdown that lets users switch between summary totals and detailed monthly tables without recalculating the scenario.\\n    73\\t\\n    74\\t### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n    75\\t\\n    76\\t- **Investment Scenario**: Captures user-provided parameters (initial balance, monthly contribution, interest assumptions, duration, custody tax, come-cotas flag) and the validation state for each field.\\n    77\\t- **Tax Schedule**: Encapsulates Brazilian income tax brackets and come-cotas withholding events used to compute periodic tax debits relative to the investment horizon.\\n    78\\t- **Simulation Summary**: Stores calculated totals (contributions, interest, custody tax, income tax, net balance, effective aliquot) and references the month-by-month ledger used for drill-down.\\n    79\\t\\n    80\\t## Assumptions\\n    81\\t\\n    82\\t- Users contribute the same amount every month; the system treats missed or variable contributions as outside the feature scope.\\n    83\\t- Monthly interest rate represents expected gross performance before taxes, and the annual yield supplied by the user is intended as the effective annual rate for cross-checking purposes.\\n    84\\t- Income tax calculations follow the standard Brazilian long-term fund brackets (22.5% up to 6 months, 20% up to 12 months, 17.5% up to 24 months, 15% beyond 24 months), with come-cotas withholding occurring in May and November.\\n    85\\t- Custody tax is charged once per year at the entered rate and is applied proportionally across months for simulation accuracy.\\n    86\\t- The interface targets current iPhone models (e.g., iPhone 14–16 family) with support for both light and dark modes; tablets and desktop layouts are handled separately.\\n    87\\t\\n    88\\t## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n    89\\t\\n    90\\t### Measurable Outcomes\\n    91\\t\\n    92\\t- **SC-001**: For scenarios up to 40 years with monthly contributions and standard tax rates, the full calculation and summary display within 2 seconds on a modern iPhone.\\n    93\\t- **SC-002**: When compared to a verified spreadsheet model, the final balance and total tax values differ by no more than 0.5%.\\n    94\\t- **SC-003**: In moderated usability tests, at least 80% of participants can correctly identify the net amount after taxes and the effective aliquot without facilitator assistance.\\n    95\\t- **SC-004**: On a 6.1\\\" iPhone reference device, all monetary values and labels remain legible (minimum 14pt equivalent) and no horizontal scrolling is required in portrait orientation.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.1}}"}}
